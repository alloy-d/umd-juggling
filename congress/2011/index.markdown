# 2011 Congress of Jugglers

The 19th annual Congress of Jugglers at the University of Maryland
will take place May 6--8, 2011. As always, it's all free, and we
invite jugglers of all ages, sizes, and skill levels to come!

If you'd like to get involved, awesome! We need jugglers to run
workshops, performers to be in the show, and crash space to accomodate
travelers. If you can help out, please contact
[Sophie Jablansky](mailto:sjablans@umd.edu).

If you'd like to offer your support as a vendor, you can get more
information [here](vendors.pdf).
